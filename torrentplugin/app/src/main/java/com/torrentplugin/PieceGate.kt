/**
 * Maps a position inside the chosen file to libtorrent pieces, and keeps only a small rolling
 * window of pieces around the read head actually being downloaded. This is what lets a large
 * torrent stream on a device with very little free space: the whole file is never fetched at
 * once - only [AHEAD_PIECES] beyond wherever the player is reading, plus a little kept behind for
 * short back-seeks. Everything outside the window is set back to IGNORE so libtorrent stops
 * pulling it.
 *
 * A reader blocks in [awaitByte] until the piece it needs is present; a seek moves the window.
